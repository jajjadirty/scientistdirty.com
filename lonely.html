			<h1>DIGESTION IN THE DUODENUM</h1>
			<p>This part is alkaline in nature.</p>

			<p>
				The arrival of food in the duodenum stimulates the production of a hormone called secretin fromthe pancrease and another hormone called cholecystokinin which stimulates secretion of bile from the gall bladder.
			</p>
			<p>
				The secretions are alkaline thus stopping the action of pepsin and providesan ideal medium for enzymes in pancreatic juice to work. Pancreatic juice contains a number of
				enzymes which are called the pancreatic enzymes.

			<p>
				Trypsin is also secreted in an inactive form,trypsinogen to prevent it from digesting the
				duodenum walls.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both trypsin and pancreatic amylase act upon proteins and starch that were not broken down in
				the stomach and mouth respectively.

			<h2>Note</h2>
			<p>
				The chime from the stomach enters the duodenum in small quantities at a time regulated by the
				pyloric sphincter.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are access organs which provide secretions. They secret bile from the
				gall bladder and pancreatic juice from the pancrease

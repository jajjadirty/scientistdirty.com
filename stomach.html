			<h1>DIGESTION IN THE STOMACH</h1>
			<p>This is where proteins are digested from.</p>

			<center><h2>THE STOMACH</h2></center>
			<p>When food reaches the stomach from the oesophagus, it stimulates the secreation of gastric juice and it contains two enzymes called pepsin and renin</p>
			<p>The stomach contains hydrochloric acid which kills germs that escape with food and creates acidic conditions for pepsin and renin to work hence stoping the salivary amylase from working.</p>
			<p>Pepsin changes proteins into pepdides and renin regulates milk (it converts the soluble milk proteins to an insoluble curd, it is usally active in young mammals since they feed on milk.)</p>
			<p>The mucus in the stomach forms a barrier between the stomach walls and gastric juice thus protecting the stomach walls from the action of hydrochloric acid which can cause stomach ulcers 
			due to its corrosive action.And stop the action of pepsin which can digestedthe stomach walls.</p>

			<h2>Note</h2>
			<p>Pepsin is initially secreted in an inactive from called pepsinogen which is activated into active 
			pepsin by hydrochloric acid. This is a safe guard because if pepsin was stored in its active form, it
			would destroy the stomach walls since their protein in neture.</p>
			<p>Digestion in the stomach is chemical.</p>
			<p>When food lives the stomach it is no longer called food its called chime</p>
